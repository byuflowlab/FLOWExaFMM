# MyExaFMM
My private version of ExaFMM. The purpose of this repo is to integrate MyVPM directly into the ExaFMM code as a full VPM code rather than a generic FMM.

This repo was initiated as a copy of the FLOWVPM_integration branch from my [previous fork of ExaFMM](https://github.com/EdoAlvarezR/exafmm/tree/FLOWVPM_integration) on Aug 10th, 2018.

All modifications are done on the 3d folder.
